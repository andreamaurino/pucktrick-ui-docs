# Introduction

Introducing **Pucktrick**, The definitive library for **introducing a controlled amount of specific errors into datasets**. In various research activities, it is necessary to contaminate a dataset in order to study its effects. However, this task is highly complex and prone to producing datasets with characteristics that diverge from the intended ones, potentially hindering the accurate execution of experiments. Pucktrick was developed to alleviate this burden,defining specific methods for different types of data and errors, allowing users to contaminate a dataset by introducing a known percentage of a specific type of error.

Pucktrick offers **a wide range of methods** for contaminating a dataset, and new features will be added based on user requests. 

With Pucktrick, you can focus on what truly mattersâ€”advancing your work in data-related field, while enjoying the benefits of a sophisticated library designed to enhance productivity and streamline your workflow ðŸ’…. Say goodbye to the complexities of dataset contamination  and embrace the efficiency and versatility of Pucktrick.

This manual is designed to comprehensively walk through every aspect of setting up and using Pucktrick, including functions and features.
